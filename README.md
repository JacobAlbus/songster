## Inspiration
Pre-pandemic we would often enjoy music with the company of others. We would sing along to artists like *Taylor Swift and Kanye*. Since then, however, we have been confined inside with seemingly endless Zoom meeting and classes. Seldom could we find a meaningful way to enjoy music with other virtually. This is why we created Songster. By creating a novel way to enjoy music, we have found a way to ease the physical distance between our family and friends: **a way to rekindle connections.**
